## Understanding Exchange Rates: Fixed vs. Floating

### Fixed-Rate Crypto Exchange  
Ideal for risk-averse traders, fixed rates guarantee the exact amount of USDC youâ€™ll receive. For example, swapping 100 GUSD at a fixed rate of **0.4316 USDC/GUSD** ensures you receive **43.16 USDC**, even if prices fluctuate during processing.  

### Floating-Rate Crypto Exchange  
Floating rates depend on market conditions. If the GUSD/USDC rate rises from 0.4316 to 0.45 during your transaction, youâ€™ll receive more USDC. However, a drop to 0.41 means fewer tokens.  

**Key Consideration**: Use floating rates only if youâ€™re comfortable with market volatility.
