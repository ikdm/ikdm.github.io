## Do I Have to Pay Taxes on My Crypto?

Yes, cryptocurrency transactions are subject to taxation under U.S. law. The IRS treats crypto as property, meaning gains and losses must be reported annually. Key taxable events include:

- **Selling crypto for fiat currency** (e.g., USD)
- **Trading one crypto for another** (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum)
- **Using crypto to purchase goods/services**
- **Receiving crypto as income** (e.g., staking rewards, airdrops)

### Tax-Free Crypto Activities
- **Holding crypto in a wallet** (no taxable event until disposal)
- **Transferring crypto between personal wallets**
- **Gifting crypto under $15,000/year** (no gift tax required)

> **Pro Tip**: Even minor transactions, like buying a coffee with Bitcoin, trigger tax reporting requirements.

## How to File Your Crypto Taxes: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Gather Transaction Data
Track these details for every transaction:
- Amount and type of crypto involved
- Fiat value at acquisition and disposal
- Dates of purchase and sale
- Purpose of transaction (investment, income, etc.)

### Step 2: Calculate Capital Gains/Losses
Use this formula:
```
Sale Proceeds - Cost Basis = Capital Gain/Loss
```

**Example**:  
Bought Litecoin for $5,000 (including fees)  
Sold for $7,500  
Capital Gain = $2,500

### Step 3: Choose an Accounting Method
Different methods yield varying tax liabilities:
| Method | Description | Tax Impact |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **FIFO** | First In, First Out | Higher gains if prices rise |
| **LIFO** | Last In, First Out | Lower gains in bull markets |
| **Specific ID** | Track individual units | Most control over gains |

### Step 4: Complete Required Tax Forms
- **Form 8949**: Detail each transaction
- **Schedule D**: Report total capital gains/losses
- **Schedule 1 (Form 1040)**: Report crypto income
