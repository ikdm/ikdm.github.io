# Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Tether (USD) Indicator  

## Understanding the Crypto Market Cap Indicator  

The **Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Tether (USDT)** is a specialized metric designed to provide traders and analysts with a clearer picture of the cryptocurrency marketâ€™s value by removing the influence of stablecoins like Tether. This indicator tracks the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except Tether, offering insights into market trends driven by volatile assets rather than fiat-pegged tokens.  

### Why Exclude Tether?  
Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin with a fixed value tied to the US dollar. Its primary purpose is to maintain price stability, making it a tool for traders to park funds rather than a speculative asset. Including Tether in total market cap calculations can distort perceptions of market growth or contraction, as its supply is artificially manipulated by issuers. By excluding Tether, this indicator focuses on the organic performance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins.

## How the Indicator Works  

The indicator operates by:  
1. **Filtering Tether**: Automatically excludes Tetherâ€™s market cap from total calculations.  
2. **Threshold Alerts**: Highlights when the adjusted market cap crosses predefined upper or lower bounds (e.g., $2.25 trillion to $2.5 trillion).  
3. **Midpoint Analysis**: Adds a dynamic horizontal line representing support/resistance levels between thresholds.  
4. **Visual Customization**: Allows users to toggle bar coloring, candlestick displays, and alert settings.  

### Key Features  
- **Alert System**: Users can enable alerts for threshold breaches or midpoint crossings.  
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Adjustable upper/lower bounds with customizable color schemes.  
- **USDC Exclusion Option**: Further refine data by excluding USD Coin (USDC), another major stablecoin.  
- **Price Source Optimization**: Uses low/high price data relative to the midpoint to avoid missing market wicks.  

## Configuration Options  

To tailor the indicator to your trading strategy, adjust the following parameters:  

| Setting                | Description                                                                 |  
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Lower Bound**        | Set the minimum market cap threshold (e.g., $2.25 trillion).                |  
| **Upper Bound**        | Define the maximum threshold (e.g., $2.5 trillion).                         |  
| **Color Scheme**       | Choose colors for bars/alerts above/below thresholds.                       |  
| **Midpoint Toggle**    | Enable/disable the midpoint support/resistance line.                        |  
| **USDC Exclusion**     | Exclude USD Coin from calculations for stricter stablecoin filtering.       |  

## Updates and Enhancements  

Recent updates to the indicator include:  
- **Candlestick Display**: Visualize market cap data as candlesticks for trend analysis.  
- **Midpoint Alerts**: Added alerts for when the market cap crosses the midpoint.  
- **Consistent Line Plotting**: Ensures visual consistency across multiple charts.  
- **Dynamic Price Sourcing**: Adjusts for volatility by using low/high prices relative to the midpoint.  

The creator emphasizes that while the indicatorâ€™s current thresholds (e.g., $2.25Tâ€“$2.5T) align with historical patterns, market dynamics may evolve. Users should monitor trends as extreme bullish or bearish movements could render current thresholds obsolete.
