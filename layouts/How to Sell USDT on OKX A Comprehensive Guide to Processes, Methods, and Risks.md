     - **Market vs. Limit Orders**: Use limit orders to set desired prices, or market orders for immediate execution.  
     - **Price Volatility**: Rapid market swings may lead to slippage, affecting final returns.

  - **Track Market Trends**: Use OKXâ€™s real-time price charts and technical analysis tools to identify favorable selling windows.  
  - **Set Price Alerts**: Configure notifications for specific USDT pair movements (e.g., USDT/BTC).  
  - **Diversify Pairs**: Explore trading pairs beyond BTC/ETH to mitigate volatility exposure.  

- **Impact of Fiat Stability**:  
  - USDTâ€™s peg to the USD ensures minimal fiat-related volatility, but regulatory developments or issuer audits may temporarily affect confidence.
