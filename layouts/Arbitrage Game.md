### Key Concepts and Market Applications  

Arbitrage thrives on market inefficiencies, where identical assets trade at divergent prices across platforms. For instance:  
- **Currency Arbitrage**: Exploiting exchange rate disparities between forex markets.  
- **ETF Arbitrage**: Leveraging price gaps between exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their underlying assets.  
- **Cryptocurrency Arbitrage**: Profiting from valuation mismatches across digital asset exchanges.  

These strategies are not confined to financeâ€”global supply chains, e-commerce, and commodity trading also utilize arbitrage logic to optimize profits.  

**Core Keywords**: Arbitrage Trading, Market Price Discrepancies, Low-Risk Investment, ETF Arbitrage, Cryptocurrency Arbitrage
