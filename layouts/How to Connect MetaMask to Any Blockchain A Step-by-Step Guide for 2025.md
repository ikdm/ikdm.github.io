# How to Connect MetaMask to Any Blockchain: A Step-by-Step Guide for 2025

## Understanding MetaMask: Your Gateway to Web3  

**MetaMask** is a leading cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that serves as a bridge between traditional web2 and decentralized web3 environments. As an Ethereum-based wallet, it enables users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. With over 30 million users globally, MetaMask supports Ethereum (ETH) and tokens built on standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFTs).  

While MetaMask defaults to the Ethereum blockchain, its versatility lies in its ability to connect to multiple blockchains. This guide will walk you through the process of linking MetaMask to networks like **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, **Avalanche (AVAX)**, **Polygon (MATIC)**, **Harmony**, **Fantom**, and others.

## Connecting MetaMask to Blockchains: Manual vs. Automatic Methods  

There are two primary methods to add blockchains to MetaMask:  

### **1. Using Chainlist for Automatic Connection**  
[Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) is a third-party tool that simplifies adding EVM-compatible networks. Here‚Äôs how:  
1. Visit Chainlist and search for your desired blockchain (e.g., Avalanche).  
2. Click ‚ÄúAdd to MetaMask‚Äù and confirm the action in your wallet.  

**Pros**: Easy and fast.  
**Cons**: Relies on third-party data, which may occasionally be outdated.  

### **2. Manual Configuration (Recommended for Security)**  
Manually input network details for greater control:  
1. Open MetaMask and select **‚ÄúNetworks‚Äù > ‚ÄúCustom RPC‚Äù**.  
2. Enter the required parameters (Network Name, RPC URL, ChainID, etc.).  

This method ensures accuracy and avoids dependency on external platforms.
