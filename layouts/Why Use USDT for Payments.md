# Why Use USDT for Payments?

## The Foundation of USDT Stability  
USDT (Tether) operates under a 1:1 reserve guarantee, ensuring every USDT token is backed by one US dollar. This collateralization mechanism creates unparalleled stability compared to other cryptocurrencies, making it a preferred choice for businesses and individuals seeking reliable digital transactions. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDT maintains consistent value, reducing financial risks in cross-border payments and everyday commerce.
